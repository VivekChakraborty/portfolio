# portfolio
This is a personal portfolio of Vivek. It contains my personal projects, showcasing my skills, expertise, and creativity in handling data.

This repository showcases a collection of data analyst projects aimed at demonstrating proficiency in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Each project explores diverse datasets, employing a range of techniques to extract meaningful insights. The portfolio is designed to highlight skills in Python, SQL, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using PowerBI.
As a Data Analyst, having industry experience in hand, along with personal projects seem to be something which opens up the path of self growth.
