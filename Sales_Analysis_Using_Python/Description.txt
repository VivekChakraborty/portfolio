Here is a dataset, containing sales information during the time of festive season i.e - Diwali.

We need to perform Exploratory Data Analysis to analyse the dataset and get meaningful insights from it.

The data driven insights can be helpful in the upcoming time, for various reasons, as the EDA performed here can be used for multiple purposes, to get to conclusions.

The steps followed and the insights can be found in the Jupyter notebook.

Here I have used Pandas to create the dataframe and perform data cleaning using few functions. Then used the Seaborn library to create few visualizations and charts, to get to the conclusion.

The insights from each section and the final conclusion derived from the analysis is mentioned in the Jupyter Notebook.
